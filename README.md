# United States Geological Survey

I completed this project during my time at the [Columbia Engineering Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.cvn.columbia.edu/data/nyc/landing/?s=Google-Brand&pkw=%2Bdata%20%2Banalytics%20%2Bcolumbia&pcrid=392444639754&pmt=b&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=%5BS%5D_GRD_Data_Brand_ALL_NYC_BMM_New&utm_term=%2Bdata%20%2Banalytics%20%2Bcolumbia&utm_content=392444639754&s=google&k=%2Bdata%20%2Banalytics%20%2Bcolumbia&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2b7uBRDsARIsAEE9XpFH-2wU0-_7jtxCV_PCkGBR0prlyKtvpF2-nAWU1tO4oYci5h1QStsaAsg5EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) located in New York, NY.

The purpose of this project is to help the United States Geological Survey (USGS) visualize earthquake data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.

The final map includes the following features:

1. Data collected from the USGS, which provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes

2. An URL of the USGS JSON to pull in the data for the visualization

3. A map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude

4. Data markers that reflects the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color

5. Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked

6. A legend that provides context for your map data


## Methods Used
* Data Visualization
* Data Collection
* Mapping


## Technologies
* Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Jypyter Notebook)


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2.  Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and pick a data set to visualize.
2. CSVs can be found in the [data](https://github.com/CarolineDelva/Pyber-Matplotlib-Project/tree/master/Pyber/data) in this repository.

3. The Python script is located in the [Pyber](https://github.com/CarolineDelva/Pyber-Matplotlib-Project/blob/master/Pyber/pyber%20script.ipynb) folder.
4. Run the script in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
